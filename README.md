# Analysis_olist - Datascience - Product category VS reviews
In this project we will explore the Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist and conduct basic statistical analysis and A/B testing to draw insights from the data.

**Dataset Description**:
The Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist contains information about orders, customers, products, and payments from 2016 to 2018. It includes data on orders made at Olist Store, which is divided into multiple datasets linked by unique identifiers.

Problematic: I would like to study the correlation between product category and the customer satisfaction rating. Let's do it !
